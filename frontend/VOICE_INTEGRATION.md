2. Edit any mistakes or add additional details
3. Fill in the project information fields
4. Click "Create Project" to submit

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- **VoiceInput.js**: Main voice input component with Web Speech API integration
- **EnhancedCreateRequirement.js**: Updated to include voice input option

### API Integration

- Voice input uses the same backend API as transcript input
- Transcribed content is sent to `/api/inputs/transcript` endpoint
- Source is marked as "voice_input" for tracking

### Key Features

```javascript
// Web Speech API Configuration
recognition.continuous = true; // Continuous listening
recognition.interimResults = true; // Show interim results
recognition.lang = "en-US"; // Language setting
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Browser not supported**: Clear message with supported browser list
2. **Microphone permission**: Browser will prompt for microphone access
3. **Network issues**: Graceful fallback to manual input
4. **Recognition errors**: User-friendly error messages

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check browser compatibility
- Minimize background noise
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Multiple language support**: Support for different languages
- **Voice commands**: Navigate the app using voice
- **Audio playback**: Play back recorded audio for verification
- **Advanced editing**: Voice-based text editing commands

### Technical Improvements

- **Offline support**: Local speech recognition
- **Custom models**: Domain-specific speech recognition
- **Batch processing**: Process multiple voice inputs
- **Analytics**: Track voice input usage and accuracy

## Development Notes

### Testing

- Test in different browsers
- Verify microphone permissions
- Check error handling scenarios
- Validate API integration

### Performance

- Voice recognition is client-side only
- No additional server load
- Minimal impact on bundle size
- Efficient memory usage

## Security Considerations

### Privacy

- Audio is processed locally in the browser
- No audio data is sent to servers
- Only transcribed text is transmitted
- Standard HTTPS encryption for API calls

### Permissions

- Requires microphone access
- Browser handles permission management
- Clear user consent required
- Graceful degradation if denied
